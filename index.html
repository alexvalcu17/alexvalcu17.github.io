            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Finding skilled and reliable service providers is a time-consuming and frustrating process for individuals, 
                as it often involves searching through unverified sources or relying on word-of-mouth. Service providers, 
                on the other hand, struggle to gain visibility and connect with potential clients, limiting their ability 
                to grow their businesses.</p>

            <h2>How we identified the problem?</h2>
            <p>During initial research, we found that individuals in Romania looking for service providers often face significant challenges, 
                such as lack of trust, inconsistent quality of services, and inefficient booking processes. People rely heavily on recommendations 
                from friends, social media groups, or outdated online listings that lack verified reviews and detailed information. Additionally, 
                service providers struggle to find reliable clients and build their reputations in a crowded marketplace. The core problem centers 
                on the absence of a centralized, trustworthy, and user-friendly platform where service seekers can easily connect with verified 
                providers and manage bookings seamlessly.

            <div class="text-and-image">
                <p>Having all these set, we started looking for people who would be interested in our idea. We used social media platforms such as
                    Facebook, Whatsapp and Messenger to connect with potential customers on community groups. Informal interviews revealed key insights 
                    into both customer and provider needs.,
                    adding a few of the evidence we gathered to our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17VIiAVUOnTqEtAtc0itW3vvbHdiaWti7">Google Drive</a>.
                    For instance, many customers emphasized the importance of verified reviews and reliable booking systems, while providers highlighted the challenge of 
                    gaining trust and visibility. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We tried to adopt an approach which is indicated in the Mom Test book, and so we decided on 3 main questions to be asked during the interviews
                    and some additional questions depending on the answers we received. We also tried to keep the conversation as natural as possible, to make the
                    interviewee feel comfortable and to get the most honest answers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The main questions were:

            <p>
            <p>The potential customers we interviewed provided rich insights into their experiences and challenges with hiring service providers. 
                We discovered that many individuals rely on informal methods such as recommendations from friends and family or social media groups 
                to find professionals. While these methods offer some level of trust, they often lack consistency and reliability. Interviewees 
                highlighted the need for a platform that centralizes verified reviews and offers transparent information about qualifications and 
                certifications to make informed decisions confidently. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A recurring theme among the customers was the frustration of service providers not showing up or canceling appointments at the last minute. 
                This left many scrambling to find alternatives, leading to delays in resolving urgent problems. Customers expressed a strong interest in 
                features like guaranteed bookings, real-time availability, and notifications to avoid these inconveniences. Additionally, they appreciated 
                the idea of a system where service providers are held accountable for reliability and punctuality through ratings and reviews.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another common challenge was the time it takes to find a suitable provider for specific needs, particularly for urgent or specialized services 
                such as plumbing or electrical repairs. Most participants noted that they preferred platforms with robust search and filter options to quickly 
                identify the right fit based on their criteria. They also valued recommendations and reviews from verified customers to ensure quality and 
                trustworthiness.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Service providers, on the other hand, revealed their struggles with visibility and building trust among new customers. Many expressed interest in 
                a system that highlights their verified credentials, customer testimonials, and work portfolios. They believed that these features would enhance 
                their reputation and attract more clients. Additionally, they mentioned the need for tools to manage bookings and communicate effectively with 
                customers, reducing misunderstandings and improving efficiency.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While most of the interviews yielded valuable insights, a few participants expressed skepticism about adopting a new platform. Their concerns 
                revolved around the learning curve and costs. However, this feedback underscored the importance of designing a user-friendly interface and 
                offering flexible subscription plans to cater to different user segments, including occasional users and small-scale service providers.</p>

                <p>Providers wanted tools to simplify their work. We introduced features like earnings tracking, schedule management, and promotion options

        <h2>Ready for customer validation stage?</h2>
            <p>We believe we are ready to enter the Customer Validation stage. We have a clear understanding of user needs and have tailored our app to address 
                these pain points with features like verified profiles, instant booking, and robust rating systems. Feedback from initial interviews shows strong interest in a reliable, transparent platform that simplifies the process of finding and hiring service providers.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our next step is to launch a beta version of the app with a select group of users, including both service seekers and providers, to test usability and gather detailed feedback. This stage will help us refine key features, validate the subscription model, and 
                ensure the app meets the expectations of our target audience.

                    From these, we concluded that our solution might be very useful for both clients and workers. Mainly, clients need reliable workers to solve 
                their problems efficiently and effectively. They often face challenges in finding trustworthy professionals who can deliver quality services 
                on time. Our platform addresses this issue by providing a centralized location where clients can search for and book skilled workers with ease. 
                The platform's features, such as verified profiles, customer reviews, and real-time availability, ensure that clients can make informed decisions 
                and find the right professional for their needs quickly.</p>
                <p>On the other side, there are many skilled workers whose services are not promoted well enough, leading to underutilization of their skills and 
                    potential. These workers often struggle to reach a broader audience and secure consistent work. Our application offers them a valuable 
                    opportunity to showcase their services to a larger pool of potential clients. By creating detailed profiles, highlighting their qualifications,
                     and receiving verified reviews, workers can build their reputation and attract more clients. The platform also provides tools for managing 
                     bookings and tracking earnings, helping workers streamline their operations and grow their businesses.
                <p>Overall, our solution bridges the gap between clients seeking reliable services and workers looking for more visibility and opportunities. 
                    It creates a win-win situation where clients can easily find and hire trustworthy professionals, and workers can expand their client base 
                    and enhance their careers.</p>

                    variety of workers from the app, he can see their profiles and choose to do a booking - in this step, he chooses a date and an hour depending
                    on the worker's availability, then adds a payment method and confirms the booking. Also, each client has its personal profile page with 
                    relevant details.</p>
