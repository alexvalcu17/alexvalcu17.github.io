        <h3>[UPDATE] Small Note</h3>
        <p>Our first startup idea was AgroManager - an integrated breeding and vaccination management system that notifies farmers and creates
            customized schedules based on their specific farm data, offering performance metrics visualization to empower farmers with insights
            to make decisions for optimizing production.</p>
        <p>Even though we considered this an impressive project, during the validation stage we decided to abort this idea and focus on something
            else due to several reasons. One major difficulty was getting in touch with farmers because they are not very active on social media
            and the ones we managed to talk to were not very interested in digitalising their farms and preferred the traditional way of doing things.
            In addition to this, our Unfair Advantage, a rabbit farmer holding a Youtube channel with more than 5k views per video who we managed to 
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1dc-Ifpu0re9yzV434t0ovwyynOm9NPqF">visit</a>,
            proved to be of not very much help for us, as we would end doing an application based only on rabbit farmers and there are not so many farms of 
            these kind worldwide in order to have a sellable project.</p>
        <p> Having all these information, we changed our idea into the project that is described below. </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Finding skilled and reliable service providers is a time-consuming and frustrating process for individuals, 
                as it often involves searching through unverified sources or relying on word-of-mouth. Service providers, 
                on the other hand, struggle to gain visibility and connect with potential clients, limiting their ability 
                to grow their businesses.</p>

                users to search, filter, and book professionals based on reviews, availability, and proximity. The platform

            <h2>How we identified the problem?</h2>
            <p>During initial research, we found that individuals in Romania looking for service providers often face significant challenges, 
                such as lack of trust, inconsistent quality of services, and inefficient booking processes. People rely heavily on recommendations 
                from friends, social media groups, or outdated online listings that lack verified reviews and detailed information. Additionally, 
                service providers struggle to find reliable clients and build their reputations in a crowded marketplace. The core problem centers 
                on the absence of a centralized, trustworthy, and user-friendly platform where service seekers can easily connect with verified 
                providers and manage bookings seamlessly.

            <p>Our solution is a comprehensive app that acts as a marketplace connecting service providers and customers across multiple categories, 
                such as housekeeping, plumbing and many others. The app offers features like verified profiles, customer reviews, live 
                availability tracking, and instant booking. Additionally, it includes a secure communication system, payment options, and personalized 
                service recommendations based on customer preferences. For service providers, the platform offers tools to manage bookings, track earnings, 
                and build their reputation through verified ratings and reviews. By simplifying and automating the process, the app aims to create a reliable 
                ecosystem for both service seekers and providers.</p>

            <div class="text-and-image">
                <p>Having all these set, we started looking for people who would be interested in our idea. We used social media platforms such as
                    Facebook, Whatsapp and Messenger to connect with potential customers on community groups. Informal interviews revealed key insights 
                    into both customer and provider needs.,
                    adding a few of the evidence we gathered to our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17VIiAVUOnTqEtAtc0itW3vvbHdiaWti7">Google Drive</a>.
                    For instance, many customers emphasized the importance of verified reviews and reliable booking systems, while providers highlighted the challenge of 
                    gaining trust and visibility. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We tried to adopt an approach which is indicated in the Mom Test book, and so we decided on 3 main questions to be asked during the interviews
                    and some additional questions depending on the answers we received. We also tried to keep the conversation as natural as possible, to make the
                    interviewee feel comfortable and to get the most honest answers.
                    <br>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>The potential customers we interviewed provided rich insights into their experiences and challenges with hiring service providers. 
                We discovered that many individuals rely on informal methods such as recommendations from friends and family or social media groups 
                to find professionals. While these methods offer some level of trust, they often lack consistency and reliability. Interviewees 
                highlighted the need for a platform that centralizes verified reviews and offers transparent information about qualifications and 
                certifications to make informed decisions confidently. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A recurring theme among the customers was the frustration of service providers not showing up or canceling appointments at the last minute. 
                This left many scrambling to find alternatives, leading to delays in resolving urgent problems. Customers expressed a strong interest in 
                features like guaranteed bookings, real-time availability, and notifications to avoid these inconveniences. Additionally, they appreciated 
                the idea of a system where service providers are held accountable for reliability and punctuality through ratings and reviews.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another common challenge was the time it takes to find a suitable provider for specific needs, particularly for urgent or specialized services 
                such as plumbing or electrical repairs. Most participants noted that they preferred platforms with robust search and filter options to quickly 
                identify the right fit based on their criteria. They also valued recommendations and reviews from verified customers to ensure quality and 
                trustworthiness.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Service providers, on the other hand, revealed their struggles with visibility and building trust among new customers. Many expressed interest in 
                a system that highlights their verified credentials, customer testimonials, and work portfolios. They believed that these features would enhance 
                their reputation and attract more clients. Additionally, they mentioned the need for tools to manage bookings and communicate effectively with 
                customers, reducing misunderstandings and improving efficiency.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While most of the interviews yielded valuable insights, a few participants expressed skepticism about adopting a new platform. Their concerns 
                revolved around the learning curve and costs. However, this feedback underscored the importance of designing a user-friendly interface and

            <p>Our next step is to launch a beta version of the app with a select group of users, including both service seekers and providers, to test usability and gather detailed feedback. This stage will help us refine key features, validate the subscription model, and 
                ensure the app meets the expectations of our target audience.

                    From these, we concluded that our solution might be very useful for both clients and workers. Mainly, clients need reliable workers to solve 
                their problems efficiently and effectively. They often face challenges in finding trustworthy professionals who can deliver quality services 
                on time. Our platform addresses this issue by providing a centralized location where clients can search for and book skilled workers with ease. 
                The platform's features, such as verified profiles, customer reviews, and real-time availability, ensure that clients can make informed decisions 
                and find the right professional for their needs quickly.</div>
                
                <div style="text-align: justify;">On the other side, there are many skilled workers whose services are not promoted well enough, leading to underutilization of their skills and 
                    potential. These workers often struggle to reach a broader audience and secure consistent work. Our application offers them a valuable 
                    opportunity to showcase their services to a larger pool of potential clients. By creating detailed profiles, highlighting their qualifications,
                     and receiving verified reviews, workers can build their reputation and attract more clients. The platform also provides tools for managing 
                     bookings and tracking earnings, helping workers streamline their operations and grow their businesses.
                Overall, our solution bridges the gap between clients seeking reliable services and workers looking for more visibility and opportunities. 
                    It creates a win-win situation where clients can easily find and hire trustworthy professionals, and workers can expand their client base 
                    and enhance their careers.</div>

                    on the worker's availability, then adds a payment method and confirms the booking. Also, each client has its personal profile page with

                    also review their list of bookings to stay organized and keep track of upcoming appointments. Additionally, they have access to the feedback 
                    and reviews left by clients, enabling them to understand their strengths and identify areas for improvement. By managing their profile, 
                    monitoring their bookings, and leveraging client feedback, workers can continuously refine their services and attract more potential clients.

            more followers and users in the application (monitorised through Posthog), TikTok helped us create engaging content which gained a lot of
            views and that resonated with our target audience. We plan to continue using both platforms, as well as Whatsapp for sharing 
            the application link through different groups, to promote our app and engage with potential users.

                    <h2>Target Market</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">In Romania, there are millions of households that frequently require skilled professionals for home repairs, 
                        maintenance, and personal services. The vast majority of Romanian households, being owner-occupied (approximately 96% of the population), 
                        regularly face challenges in finding reliable service providers. This creates a substantial demand for platforms like QuickFix that simplify 
                        access to skilled workers.</div>
                        <br>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">To analyze the market, we examined popular channels currently used to find service providers, such as 
                        Facebook groups and platforms like OLX. In addition to groups directly advertising handyman services, we also explored communities where 
                        people share opinions and reviews about different service providers. These groups demonstrate the growing importance of trust and 
                        transparency, which QuickFix addresses with its rating and review functionality. By integrating this feature, QuickFix not only connects 
                        users with professionals but also builds confidence in the quality of services provided:

            <h2>Minimum Viable Product</h2>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">For this milestone, we built the MVP of our solution, considering all the feedback and insights gathered from
                the previous stages. The MVP includes the core features that address the pain points of both clients and workers, providing a seamless
                experience for managing connections between clients and workers. The MVP focuses on essential functionalities such as user registration, profile
                creation, service search and messaging. By prioritizing these features, we aim to deliver a user-friendly platform that
                meets the needs of our target audience and provides a solid foundation for future iterations and enhancements.

            <br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">We started by developing an Android application (which is ready and can be used, while the iOS and Web versions are 
                in development), as it is the most popular operating system in Romania. The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a clean and 
                modern interface that appeals to users of all ages. The MVP is added to the <a href="https://andreeas11.github.io/landing/">Landing Page</a> so that users 
                can download and access it in order to test the features and provide feedback.Then, we will be able to add the app to the Google Play Store and Apple App 
                Store for wider distribution and user acquisition.
                <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned before, the reason for building an Android app first is that it has the largest market share in Romania and 
                it is the fastest option for us to have a product ready to go to market.

            <h2>First Sale</h2>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">First sale is a significant milestone for any startup, as it validates the product-market fit and demonstrates that
                customers are willing to pay for the solution. For QuickFix, we used our social media channels, Instagram and TikTok, to promote the app and generate
                interest among potential users. </div>

                <br>
                <div style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, we sent newsletters to our subscribers from the Landing page, informing them about the app's launch and
                encouraging them to download and try it. We decided not to require payment for the first bookings, as we wanted to gather both workers and clients.

                we sent our app.

                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this, we also requested feedback from the persons who created accounts in the application,
                        receiving positive reviews regarding to the ability of finding service providers quickly based on specific criteria like location or 
                        service type, the ability to communicate easily with the service providers for discussing details and scheduling, as well as user-friendly
                        registration and interface. The workers claimed that showcasing their portfolio and qualifications on the platform helped them attract
                        more clients and grow their businesses.

                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, we also received some constructive feedback, such as advanced features like booking tools
                        or verified reviews. These aspects will be deployed in the app in the next update and will also be available to the Web app that is currently
                        under deployment and will be released soon.
