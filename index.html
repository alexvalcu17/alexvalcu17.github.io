            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Farm management is labor-intensive, requiring substantial human involvement
                for scheduling breeding and vaccinations — tasks that could be automated.
                Due to the lack of dedicated management tools, farms rarely reach their full production potential.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>We provide an integrated breeding and vaccination management system that notifies farmers and creates
                customized schedules based on their specific farm data. Additionally, our platform offers performance
                metrics
                visualization, empowering farmers with insights to make decisions for optimizing production.</p>

                previously
                spent managing breeding and vaccination schedules.

            <h2>How we identified the problem?</h2>
            <p>During initial research, both on the internet and informally with some neighbours living at the
                countryside who own a couple of animals, we found out that the farm management process is still 
                done manually, with a lot of paperwork and human involvement. While some farmers were meticulous,
                many relied on ad-hoc methods to remember vaccination schedules, track breeding cycle, maintain
                animal health records, and monitor production metrics. For these, even managing a small number of
                animals became a challenge, with inbreeding prevention, accurate record-keeping and care scheduling
                emerging as frequent issues. The core problem centered around the need for a centralized, automated 
                solution that could simplify record keeping and routine management tasks, making it easier for farmers
                to manage their farms. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <h2>What we thought is a solution?</h2>
            <p>Our initial solution idea was an app designed to streamline and automate the tracking of breeding, 
                vaccinations, and health data for animal breeders - cows, horses, sheep, pigs, rabbits and others. 
                Key proposed features included relative information about the animal, automatic reminders for  
                vaccination dates, lineage tracking to prevent inbreeding, centralized storage of animal profiles, and a 
                community-focused marketplace for buying and selling animals. We anticipated that the app could reduce the 
                need for manual memory recall or paper records, creating a more organized and accessible management system.</p>

                <p>Having all these set, we started looking for people who would be interested in our idea. We used social media platforms such as
                    Facebook, Whatsapp and Messenger to connect with potential customers from Farming Groups or connections of us or our friends who
                    own animals. We managed to have a couple of discussions with horse, sheep, cow and rabbit owners, both virtually and face-to-face,
                    adding a few of the evidence we gathered to our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17VIiAVUOnTqEtAtc0itW3vvbHdiaWti7">Google Drive</a>.
                    We even managed to visit a rabbit farm! With this visit, we found out that the owner will be very interesed in being our Unfair Advantage,
                    as he is holding an Youtube channel with more than 5.8k subscribers and he is willing to promote our app on his channel, as well as give us
                    contacts about other rabbit breeders he knows.

                    We tried to adopt an approach which is indicated in the Mom Test book, and so we decided on 3 main questions to be asked during the interviews
                    and some additional questions depending on the answers we received. We also tried to keep the conversation as natural as possible, to make the
                    interviewee feel comfortable and to get the most honest answers.

            <br>
            <p>
            <p>The potential customers who agreed to give us interviews provided valuable insights into their needs and preferences. 
                We discovered that, while some breeders were highly organized and maintained detailed records, many were seeking a 
                simpler and more automated approach to managing basic tasks like breeding, vaccinations, and feed. Several interviewees 
                indicated that they currently use ad-hoc methods to track breeding cycles and vaccinations, relying on handwritten notes 
                or basic files on their computer. They highlighted the potential value of features such as automated reminders for vaccinations 
                and breeding events, which would reduce their dependency on memory and prevent missed care windows. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Moreover, a recurring theme was the challenge of keeping track of family lineage to avoid inbreeding, particularly for those who 
                don't have a structured record-keeping system. An in-app family lineage tracker with alerts for related pairings was widely seen as 
                beneficial, making it easier to sustain healthy breeding practices without additional manual work. We also noted a strong interest in 
                the ability to centralize information on each animal’s lineage, breed, and other relevant data in a digital profile.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beyond animal care, the interviewees expressed interest in an integrated animal-specific marketplace (in our case, the accent was on rabbits
                as we had more insights on them). Unlike general platforms where listings can be lost among unrelated products, a dedicated marketplace with
                verified animal profiles would simplify buying and selling, improving transparency and connecting breeders more directly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Also, there were some interviews that were not as insightful as we hoped. However, we learnt from them that our project could also help the 
                small-scale breeders. The ones who participated at our interviews, were not reluctant to using a simple app, even if they are not as invested 
                as the others into the rabbit livestock. Therefore, the idea of releasing the app with different subscription plans appeared.</p>

                dedicated marketplace. Feedback from initial interviews suggests that there is a demand for these tools, particularly the basic tracking and 
                reminder features. The positive response toward the app's simplicity and automation indicates strong potential for customer adoption.
            </p>

            <p>Our next steps will include testing the app with a beta group of interested breeders to gauge usability, willingness to pay, and refine the 
                subscription model based on real-world usage. This phase will allow us to validate our solution's effectiveness and further adapt based on user 
                feedback.
